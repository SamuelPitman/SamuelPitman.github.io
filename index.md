## Description
Welcome! I am a PhD student at the University of New South Wales (Sydney, Australia). 

I study Quantum Chemistry under the supervison of Dr Laura K. McKemmish.

Here you’ll find information about my recent work and publications. 

## Current interests
Currently, I'm interested in transition metal complexes, specifically 3d TM complexes.
I'm focusing in on the multireference nature of these systems, and investigating how often this behaviour appears.

My primary research interest is basis sets in quantum chemistry, specifically non-gaussian basis sets. The scope of this work is limited to elements 
hydrogen through to krypton, due relativistic effects becoming relevant at this point. Additionally, the difficulty (in my opinion) to get large, 
benchmark quality datasets for these systems leaves many questions open. In future, I'd like to continue to investigate relativistic methods,
in particular the ways to get large, accurate benchmark quality data in order to validate these methods.
